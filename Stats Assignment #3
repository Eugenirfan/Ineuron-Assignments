Let P1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the first state, P2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the second state, p1 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the first state, and p2 = the proportion of Republican voters in the sample from the second state. The number of voters sampled from the first state (n1) = 100, and the number of voters sampled from the second state (n2) = 100.

The mean of the difference in sample proportions: E(p1 - p2) = P1 - P2 = 0.52 - 0.47 = 0.05.

The standard deviation of the difference : np.sqrt((p1 (1 - p1) / n1) + (p2 (1 - p2) / n2)) = 0.0706

Hypothesis : H0 : p1 - p2 <= 0 H1 : p1 - p2 > 0

z_statistic = (0 - 0.05) / 0.0706

p_value for this z_statistic = 0.24

Therefore, the probability that the survey will show a greater percentage of Republican voters in the second state than in the first state is 0.24.

3.)

my_score = 1100
mean_score = 1026
std_deviation = 209

z_score = (my_score - mean_score) / std_deviation

#z_score is coming out to be : 0.354 That means my score is (0.354 * std_deviation) away from the mean in +ve direction
